## How It Works

* User Interaction: The user can type a message, speak via audio, or upload an image.
* Audio & Image Processing:
    * Audio is converted to text using Speech-to-Text.
    * Images are analyzed for descriptive details.
* AI Response: The system sends the conversation context to the OpenAI model for generating an empathetic, human-like response.
* Voice Output: The response is converted back to speech and sent to the user along with the text reply.
* Memory Management: Previous messages are stored to maintain conversation flow.
